## About The Project

<!-- Plugin description -->
`brackets` is a JetBrains Rider plugin to provide matching bracket pair colorization in your code,
just like VSCode does. The plugin supports three levels of colorization with default values set to
match VSCode.

`brackets` supports the following languages:

- C#
- F#

> Note: As of now, I don't plan on adding support for any other languages.
